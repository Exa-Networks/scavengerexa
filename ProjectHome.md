# What is ScavengerEXA #

**ScavengerEXA** is an open source application stack, designed to reduce SPAM on the internet.

**ScavengerEXA** differentiates itself from other solutions by analysing the mail leaving an network and not entering a mail server. ScavengerEXA can be run without a mail server, making it useful to a wider audience in the Internet infrastructure community (Hosting providers and Cloud services as well as ISP's, for example).

Look [here](http://code.google.com/p/scavengerexa/wiki/stop_spam_at_the_source) to see why we think it's a good idea, even if we even expect to see [this](http://code.google.com/p/scavengerexa/wiki/craphound) [craphound](http://craphound.com/spamsolutions.txt) [answer](http://code.google.com/p/scavengerexa/wiki/craphound) the day this site hit slashdot/reddit/whatever :)

# Status #

The application is [mostly done](http://code.google.com/p/scavengerexa/wiki/95_percent_done). The code is still in flux and is not yet ready for primetime, but can be deployed if you are ready to perform some few tweaks.

Follow our progress on [twitter](http://twitter.com/ScavengerEXA) - or lack of :p

# Who is behind the project ? #

**[Exa Networks Limited](http://www.exa-networks.co.uk/)**, a UK Internet Service Provider, is currently responsible for the development of the project. The software was initially created as an internal solution but was then open sourced in the hope of helping others. We feel that allowing ScavengerEXA to be deployed freely across the Internet would benefit the community, and that **everyone** has vested interests in reducing levels of spam!

# Contributing to ScavengerEXA #

The software is not in a 'turn key' state but should you be interested feel free to contact us and we will do our utmost to help you.

You can contribute to the project and its community
  * Creating and editing documents on the wiki
  * Reporting Bugs
  * Helping us with coding

It is our hope that a community will grow around this project. As none of these programs need to be integrated into a current mail solution, evaluation should be without major risk for any interested person or organisation.
