rename to 'slow' option to something clearer (can be said of a lot of option name)
the action programs have a 'port setting' it should be a 'listen with IP and port'
action-netfilter use MTA for the filtering (port:ip) when discard has a different format, make then the same

Replace the builtin dictionary cache for python memcached[1] if the current implementation causes scalability/stability issue on high load (I do not think it will tho)

Make sure that any exa specific code is optional : dependancy on vmailmgr code and vproxy code (disabling it seems logical as it is very EXA specific).

self._factory is not clear as a variable name, found one more appropriate for each factory and perform some search and replace.

action: add an action aware RBL server implementation (see if we could work with spamhauss to have ISPs sharing their detected bots)
